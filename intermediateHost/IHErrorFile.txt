#drop second acknowledgement packet
opcode data 2 0 7
#drop the read request, number is a filler (see language description)
#mode writerequest 0
#delay data 4, send it when acknowledgement 5 is seen
#delay data 4 cond ack 5
#delay data packet 40 for 20 milliseconds
#delay data 40 20
#drop the 129th acknowledgement packet
#drop ack 129
#duplicate 9th data packet twice, first send is immediate, second is when acknowledgement 12 is seen
#duplicate data 9 2 cond ack 12
#duplicate 5th acknowledgement packet twice, second is 10 milliseconds after first
#duplicate ack 5 2 10
#the following sequence sends data 4 as data (2^16)+4. This will break files, however is very difficult to protect against and is not required for this assignment
#duplicate data 4 2 cond data 4
#drop data 4
#drop data 4
#both drops are required because the first one is disabled after the first packet passes
